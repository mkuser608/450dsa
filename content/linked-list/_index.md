  "description": "This section focuses on various problems related to linked lists, including singly, doubly, and circular linked lists. Topics covered include reversing linked lists (both iterative and recursive), detecting and removing loops, finding loop starting points, removing duplicates, moving elements, adding numbers represented by linked lists, intersection problems, sorting using merge and quicksort, finding middle elements, palindrome checks, splitting circular lists, and rotations. Advanced problems include flattening linked lists, cloning with random pointers, merging k sorted lists, segregating even and odd nodes, and solving problems related to node deletion and character streams. The problems emphasize mastering linked list operations, traversal techniques, pointer manipulation, and algorithmic optimization.",
